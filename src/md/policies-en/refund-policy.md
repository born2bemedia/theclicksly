## **No Refund Policy**

1.  The Clicksly does not offer refunds for services provided. The success of advertising campaigns depends on:

    - The quality and appeal of the product or service being promoted.
    - Its relevance to the selected target audience.
    - The clarity and impact of the marketing message.
    - The reputation and visibility of the brand.

2.  While we use our expertise to optimize campaign performance, these factors are often outside our control, making refunds impractical.

## **Non-Refundable Circumstances**

Refunds will not be provided in the following situations:

1. **Lack of Understanding of Affiliate Marketing:** Affiliate marketing requires a basic understanding of how campaigns operate. A lack of knowledge or unrealistic expectations does not justify a refund.

2. **Failure to Meet Internal Business Expectations:** Campaigns that fail to align with your business goals or benchmarks due to misaligned strategies or preparation are not eligible for refunds.

3. **Providing Incomplete or Inaccurate Information:** Suboptimal results stemming from incorrect or insufficient details about your product, target audience, or business during setup cannot be grounds for a refund.

4. **Unrealistic Performance Expectations:** Affiliate marketing is a process that often requires iterative optimization. Immediate or guaranteed results cannot be expected and do not warrant a refund.

5. **Ignoring Professional Recommendations:** Refusal to implement suggested adjustments or follow recommendations based on campaign data insights is not a valid reason for seeking a refund.
